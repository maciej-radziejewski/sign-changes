# sign-changes
This repository contains code and data accompanying the paper "On the sign changes of ψ(x)-x" by M. Grześkowiak, J. Kaczorowski, Ł. Pańkowski and M. Radziejewski, supported by the grant 2021/41/B/ST1/00241 from the National Science Centre, Poland.

There are two Mathematica notebooks available:
 * `Heuristics.nb`, that shows how we searched for the best parameters,
 * `Verification.nb`, containing the final, rigorous computation.
The files `x1.txt`, ..., `x21.txt`, `zetaZeros22.txt` and `zetaZeros10000.txt` are needed to run the calculations in `Verification.nb`.

Both notebooks were created using Mathematica 13.2. We also make them available as PDF files where all results are recorded.
