# sign-changes
This repository contains code and data accompanying the paper "On the sign changes of ψ(x)-x" by M. Grześkowiak, J. Kaczorowski, Ł. Pańkowski and M. Radziejewski, supported by the grant 2021/41/B/ST1/00241 from the National Science Centre, Poland. All the files are placed in the folder `On the sign changes of ψ(x)-x`.

There are two Mathematica 13.2 notebooks available also as PDF files:

 * `Heuristics.nb`, that shows how we searched for the best parameters,
 * `Verification.nb`, containing the final, rigorous computation.

The files `x1.txt`, ..., `x21.txt`, `zetaZeros22.txt` and `zetaZeros10000.txt` are needed to run the calculations in `Verification.nb`. In addition you can download the file

 * `Presentation.nb`

containing the presentation delivered in Będlewo on 23 September 2024, at the workshop _Analytic and Explicit results of zeros of L-functions_ organized by Gautami Bhowmik (Université de Lille), Anne-Maria Ernvall-Hytönen (Helsingin Yliopisto) and Łukasz Pańkowski (Adam Mickiewicz University, Poznań).
